# G7000
Emulator of the Philips Videopac G7000 (Magnavox OdysseyÂ²)
(the G7400 isn't considered at all)

!! Attention !!
This emu of the G7000/Odyssey2 Video Game Console still has some bugs and also just works with some selected game-binaries.
Furthermore collision detection isn't implemented at all.
